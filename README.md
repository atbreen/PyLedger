**PyLedger** is a Gaming Library Management System.
It utilizes Object Oriented Programming with the use of Classes, Inheritance and Polymorphism.

To use **PyLedger** simply download the github repo and use the above command to run the program, or (even more simply), navigate to [PyLedger](https://pyledger.streamlit.app/) and use the application in the Streamlit Cloud hosted web application.

A user may start a new library from scratch, or upload an existing library in the form of a .csv with the following column headers:

_Title_, _Console_, _Platform_, _Media Type_, and _Players_.

The source code can be customized to the user's specific needs as far as attributes of each game that they wish to use.

**Pyledger** also has the ability to search through the gaming library, as well as portay stats concerning the content of the library.
